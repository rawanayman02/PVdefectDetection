# PV Defect Detection

This project is a web-based application for detecting and analyzing defects in photovoltaic (PV) panels using artificial intelligence models (YOLO and image processing).  
Users can upload thermal or electroluminescence (EL) images of solar panels, automatically analyze them, and generate detailed PDF reports.

## Features

- Upload and manage PV panel images
- Fast defect analysis using a trained YOLO model
- Automatic PDF report generation with defect details
- Display of original and processed images
- Saving reports and results in a database (SQLite)

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite
- AI Model: YOLO (Ultralytics)
