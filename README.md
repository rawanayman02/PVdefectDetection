# PV Defect Detection

This project is a web-based application for detecting and analyzing defects in photovoltaic (PV) panels using artificial intelligence techniques. The system allows users to upload thermal or electroluminescence (EL) images of solar panels, analyze them automatically, and generate detailed PDF reports containing the analysis results.

The main features of this project include image upload and management, fast defect analysis using a YOLO deep learning model, automatic generation of professional PDF reports, and storing all results and reports in a database for future reference. The application also displays both the original and the processed images to help users easily compare and interpret the findings.

The project is built using Flask as the backend framework, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface. It relies on SQLite as the database to store user information, uploaded images, and generated reports. The artificial intelligence model is implemented using the YOLO framework (Ultralytics) for object detection and defect identification.

This tool is designed to support engineers, researchers, and technicians in evaluating the condition of PV panels quickly and accurately, providing them with valuable insights and documentation that can be used in maintenance and quality control processes.
